# LaTeXume

LaTeX resume templates that I have experimented with and used. 


## Getting Started

To access the resume templates, load up the .tex files in your favourite LaTeX editor - I used TeXstudio and TeXworks for this project


### Prerequisites

Requires LaTeX to be installed on your operating system. At the time of this project I was working with Windows so I had the following
version of MiKTeX installed on my machine. 

```
MiKTeX Version 2.9
```
